# Handover

Current session snapshot: 2026-09-28. Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first.
The [documentation index](docs/README.md) defines ownership;
[project state](docs/project-state.md) owns deployment limits and open acceptance.

## Current work

Documentation cleanup completed: consolidated repeated status and procedures,
retained unique evidence in dated records, and corrected superseded snapshots.
No services, models or robot commands were run during this pass.
Implementation was previously paused by the owner at `294a1b6` (25a.4).
See the [phase ledger](docs/plan.md#6-implementation-roadmap) for scope and
[Phase 25 verification](docs/verification/phase-25-foundation-2026-09-28.md)
for the backend checks and last homelab deployment.

## Next session

1. Verify Settings · Accounts → Owner recognition in a real browser:
   opt-in, microphone recording, face capture, sample sizes, delete and
   export. Previous enrollment checks were backend-only; browser tooling
   availability must be rechecked rather than assumed.
2. Collect real, consenting owner/non-owner audio, then benchmark and
   calibrate the speaker model before implementing its production adapter.
   The [existing smoke test](docs/verification/phase-25a1-voice-benchmark-2026-09-28.md)
   used public model-card clips only. Keep the sensitivity gate off pending
   the explicit owner decision described in the [plan](docs/phase-25.md#implementation-sequence).
3. Phase 25b.1 DoA orientation is the next engineering-only option;
   visual verification has not started. AASIST benchmarking remains a
   separate, lower-priority pass.
4. Resume the owner-deferred 24g held-out run when requested: use the
   [scenario list](docs/phase-24g.md#acceptance-requirements) and
   [agreed targets](docs/phase-24g.md#agreed-numeric-targets-owner-2026-09-27),
   with conversational motion off. Include 3–5 immediate-question and
   3–5 natural-pause attempts. Record fresh evidence; the
   [previous held-out attempt](docs/verification/phase-24g-physical-2026-09-27.md#admission-fix-and-calibration-follow-up)
   failed before the timeout increased to 6 s.
5. Check the shortened privacy carry-forward window on the robot (calendar
   question, then 7–8 unrelated turns), the Trusted mode UI, and palm stop
   after the next authorized standby/wake. These live checks remain open.

## Last-reported machine state

These are previous session observations, not health checks performed during
this documentation pass. Recheck state before relying on them.

- **Nano:** booted 2026-09-27 06:47 WIB (motor supply was off on the first
  boot; the once-per-boot recovery restarted the daemon once and stopped,
  as designed). The daemon runs as PID 7340 and was `running` at 09:33Z.
  - **Checkout/image:** `c579cc8` was physically verified at 10:57:45Z;
    the later `bab441e` latency-logging build was also reported deployed.
    Inspect the actual running revision before relying on either report.
    "Hey Reachy" was armed; the arm persists in the hub database.
  - **Rollback:** `:0880b1b` (`15ba2797`), then `:b62a023` (`ebfffcef`),
    then `:6f6eb24` (`0ab5ebdf`); roll the checkout back with it.
  - **Motion:** 24f gestures and wobble were switched **on** by the owner
    at about 10:48Z; they reset to off on any embodiment restart.
  - **Access:** sudo on the Nano needs a password, so the owner runs
    `systemctl` steps and container recreates. This dev box has key SSH
    as `Reachy-Mini-Jetson`.
  - **Tools:** the system `python3` is too old for `voice-timing.py`: use
    `~/reachy-venv/bin/python`, and pass `--session N` when a log holds
    several voice sessions. There is no MediaPipe on the Nano (palm stop is
    hub-side). `opencv-python-headless` for the 24f tools is in
    `~/24f-tools` only (use `PYTHONPATH`).
  - **Logs:** `~/24f-logs` and `~/24d-logs`; the 24g image build logs are
    in `~/24g-logs`.
  - **Units:** `reachy-embodiment.service` and
    `reachy-daemon-recovery.service` are enabled, and the container has no
    Docker restart policy.
  - **Network:** embodiment is host-networked on 8100, and the daemon is on
    loopback 8000.

- **Homelab:** latest reported hub/core rebuild was `19c6545` on
  2026-09-28 06:34 UTC for encrypted benchmark capture. The capture store
  was left empty with benchmark mode off; schema remains `009_wake_arm`.
  `STT_MODEL=small.en`, `PALM_STOP_ENABLED=true` and
  `VOICE_CONTINUATION_WINDOW_MS=3000` are in the private `.env`. The
  latest pre-deploy backup is
  `~/reachy-backups/reachy-before-enrollment-hardening-deploy-20260928T063311.dump`
  (backups are 0600). Use the [homelab launcher](docs/deployment.md#homelab).
  The hub's in-memory turn records (`GET /hub/robot-voice` with the
  `REMOTE_UI_TOKEN` bearer) give per-turn STT/LLM/TTS timings. They also
  contain transcripts, so extract only what a record needs. Piper
  `en_US-lessac-medium`; search policy Auto, Brave/Exa/Tavily rotation,
  then SearXNG.
- **Local inference:** an unrelated `ovms` container serves
  `OpenVINO/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-int4-ov` on localhost:8000. Leave
  unrelated services alone.
- Hosted credentials are in gitignored `deploy/homelab/.env.local`.
  Check presence and ignore rules without printing values. No Google OAuth
  client file or live helper run has been supplied.
- Nano Tailscale endpoints to the homelab have switched between
  10.180.1.23, .54 and .254. Network cleanup remains the owner's call.

## Immediate cautions and continuation

Use [deployment boundaries](docs/deployment.md#robot-host-and-jetson-nano)
before daemon starts or motion; launcher `--check` stays read-only. Keep
conversational motion off for Phase 25 until deferred 24f acceptance passes.
Hardware work previously involved a separate Nano-side session; verify raw
device identity before accepting remote reports.

Disposable Nano scratch: `~/24g-bench`, `~/24g-src`; acceptance logs under
`/tmp/.../scratchpad/24g-acceptance/` were session-scoped, not durable.
A recreated hub downloaded small.en again (112 s before voice worked);
this was noticed but not investigated.
